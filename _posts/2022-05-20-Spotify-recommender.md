## Background
Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. In Japan, anime describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan, anime usually refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.

Since the 1980s, this particular medium has witnessed great international success with the rise of subtitles and increasing distribution through streaming services. In fact, streaming services such as Netflix have invested quite some amount in this genre. In 2019, the annual overseas exports of Japanese animation exceeded $10 billion.

## Vision
Despite rapid growth of overseas exports, stigmas about anime still linger. Take anime music as an example. A vast majority still considers anime music as cute music that might not have much meaning. Nevertheless, in the recent years, one can find traces of jazz, rock and many other elements in anime music. By exposing people to anime music that is similar to other widely-listened music, the project could bring awareness to the diversity of anime music and therefore even piques interests in the anime industry itself. Thus, the target audience of the application is those who are explorative and want to identify other sources of music that fit their taste.
